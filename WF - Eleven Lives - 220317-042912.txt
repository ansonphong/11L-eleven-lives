  - Tie into the end of the book like a loop
  - Inanna
    - In sacrifice to save the humans
      - Inana would have to become human, enslaved to live out 11 lives in service to the evolution of what the other gods considered "lesser beings" - who were genetically engineered to live short lives - the other gods shunned her because she saw the good in humans, when they just saw the dumb animals they programmed which were easy to brainwash - Like we treat farm animals
      - There was also the incalculable risk that because the human form is so dense there is a risk she could forget who she was, or do something irrational to destroy her good karma in the realm of the gods
      - She goes down onto earth and commits to 11 lives - this is the story
    - Like avatars of Vishnu, these avatars of the meta-beings
    - 
  - The origins of life, and the journey up the spiral of life
  - Everything is a dream world they orchestrated in the cosmos
  - The planets have gravity / effect on the minds of men / astrology
  - Literary technique where you know something before the protagonist and you get to watxh them react to finding out
  - Early Man
    - Early man - what existed for 50K years before humans when they were fully evolved, or standing hominids, and abstraction, art and culture appeared.
    - A bodhisattva, in the form of Inana, coming from beyond the structure of space, coming in
    - A campfire - homonids are slaughtering and cooking and eating the animals they were keeping.  They were keeping all kinds of animals. They are cooking and feasting on flesh and they are getting full, and one person stands up and says, let's eat one more, and the others are like maybe, and he goes over to slaughter another animal for the feast, and Innana is there camping with them

  - Annunaki
    - You destroy a human's world, all it takes is a meteroite or nuking an iceberg. Then you come and hang with them and teach them - come on boat so you're not intimidating
    - 7 sages 
    - We have a new prototype to test, it is very robust - anunnaki word for human - elketh
    - 
  - Ishtar To Aya
    - Ishtar was too much of a princess to help the humans so the human race was destroyed by creed of the annunaki since it didnt meet a high enough grade of spiritual sophistication, so they were destroyed by Astar / Mara / Mars - Aya / Luna (lived for 400 years, had to descend to human level) / Ishtar feels bad for that she wasnt present for thr first humans who were washed out, so she committed in meditation on death and transfered her soul to the earth, though her physical body is still in the himalyas - frozen in ice, later to thaw at the end after illuminated

    - One king defeated the other one, destroyed it completely
    - The victorious king was old, that was his endgame, then the other King died from old age after being satisfied that the killed his enemy / the other king
    - Then the villagers are all pit against each other, but they both lost their leader, so the film is about reconciliation between two tribes
    - In this setting, Aya appears with Shen, they were travelling sages spreading wisdom throughout the lands and encountering the ancient mythologies in the villages through which they roam, connecting many people, the dream weave as they called it - weaving a great dream between all the tribes and sharing tales as they travel
    - The whole series is a way to retell history, fill in all the blanks, as in Graham Hancock's work - modern scientific understanding and where that understanding lacks, retell history more robustly, fill in the blanks with sci-fi and fantasy material which is within the scope of believability considering UAPs are now a thing, it involves the interdimensional element is being taken by NASA scientists
  - Shamanic tales
  - Two warring factions - Aya tries to stop them from fighting by showing eachother their similarities rather than differences, gets them to work together stead of destroy eachother - world centric awareness - multiple non linear timelines - the one side doesn't like that - sends in Shen to spy on her - Peace Warrior 
  - Shen is sent as a double agent, from royal masters secret council - he is sent to spy on Aya - falls in love - sees that Aya just is doing what she wants to sincerely create peace - keeps gettinf messages and continues to communicate as though on mission - orders go beyond moral imperative to kill her - he quits - he has to explain to Aya he has been a spy the whole time - they don't accept - they have to run - she runs with him - they escape to mountains, leave behind their previous identities.

  - Luna travels the world post destruction of the fourth world and helps to rebuild the fifth world of spiritual masters in the great dream weave
  - Luna is travelling the world and re-uniting the traditions after they have lost everything and are humbled, all they have to depend on is their wisdom
  - Alchemists have had interaction with aliens who have come and imparted special knowledge and then disappeared, Maasaw is among them and they initiate the Hopi as the Keepers of the Land
  - The Fourth World has Collapsed and it's the building of the Fifth World, based on balance with the earth. Old world billionaires have consolidated into ever shrinking arcologies and are becoming dependent on independent tech moguls like Mara who have cornered them with inflation and creating new crypto economies.
  - People live in cyber punk village culture, and troving bands of merchant travel around at various town centers selling their warez
  - Occasionally the merchants are ransacked by theives and bandits, Luna encounters one such envcounter and deals with Compassion
  - 1900s, Yogananda, Trungpa, Osho, etc. Beatles
  -  SUB PLOT C4 - Elektra
    - Shenguan as a female in this life is Elektra, sent on a mission, to assassinate, like bodhisattva going to kill  the king before they can cause the deaths of many more, due to their own greed, and even going against the will of the generals
    - Weighing the sacrifices vs morality, etc - extend the discussion from Thanos, and be more esoteric, Shiva, around creation and destruction of worlds, passionate-less  balance - flashbacks to  the great flood and young mara
    - Immortal vs mortal - the immortal needs to be able to make those calls and take the lives of others, the mortal is the bodhisattva, mastering life and death, going in and out of life, continuing the same thread, Mara is meanwhile retains all the memories of al the things shes done going back centuries, has flashbacks, the long life isn't all that good - memory vs forgetting, life vs death, death, rebirth theme
    - The final scene of this plot ends up being a analogous microcosm of the entire plotline wrapped up in a shot period
      - There is a moment where the king suspects Elektra of being an assasin, and has a knife to her throat, and the way she is able to seduce him without telling a lie, she uses the serpents shakti and soft touch to seduce him with her arm, and then once he looses control, she immediately turns the knife back around on him and kills him by stabbing in the neck
        - That is the microcosm, the seduce, the paranoia, the overcoming with soft power
        - The empathic reaction, since Elektra started to fall in love with the king and started to understand his reasoning, it's not black or white, though you think up to the end she is going to defect then she follows through with the mission due to remembering a moment earlier with Ishtar
  - Overview
  - 
- 07 - Era 4 : Illuminated
  - Act 1 : Aya in the Arcology
    - Opening Battle Sequence - Glitch Bugs - Deep fake Surrogates
      - This is a microcosm of the final battle
      - Battle at the end between Aya and her deepfake army, dragon battle, Mara and her army of deepfakes - processing power limitations
      - The White Tigers hackers guild are fighting in alliance with Shen and Aya in the cyber space against the Dreamtech Industry security task force, who work for Mara
      - This is played out in "theatrical" mod in the staged dreams with the glitch bugs
      - Although behind the scenes of this thearical model, it's the same team but the stakes are lower
      - The Dreamtech guys know it's the White Tigers as they leave their White Tiger insignia as a mark of influence or a paw print logo at the end of every hack
      - They tell people Aya really dreams like that, though her secret is that her brain is half simulated by the program, it's the dark secret of the industry
      - That starts to be revealed when a hack happens, and it reveals 
      - The White Tigers broadcast this "truth serum" via digital / chemical means, as the devices can intoxicate people in a psychedelic way, Aya starts telling the truth
      - This blows up viral and she ends up being in the center of a shitstorm of reporters, that is when Shen sends one of the White Tigers to deliver the physical crystal key in the commotion 
    - Aya's Dark Side
      - She insults another Dreamstar at school, says she doesn't even have any paparazzi, then when Aya goes outside and the paparazzis are stalking her she says she hates them - cognitive dissonance
    - White Tigers Lair
      - Moments
        - White tiger is making a deep fake and releasing it to expose the truth - this new age guru who takes this propaganda too far and shows himself having sex with his followers in the advertisement. They are having a philosophical discussion because it's a true act they know was proven to happen, though they deep faked a version of it to convey what happened in the fake advertisement which was circulating on the dark web. It was a true lie, and how can the karma be reckoned with - is the deep fake telling the truth of the situation with a visual language even though it's a fake image?
          - They consult Shen - he advises that to do nothing is what a noble man does, pick your battles and focus them on yourself rather than on external opponents. Conquer your greed, your fear, conquer the stain of hatred and free your heart from it's shackles. These politics will get you nowhere.
        - White Tigers joking One pulls one over on the other guy
          - That's false because the inverted paradox theorem states that you're always wrong and I'm always right.
          - Other: Man that was disproven by the Fermi Paradox which states that we're just inhabiting a thin piece of subspace and time, while other beings far larger than us live out their lives as galaxies and celestial bodies
        - MEME LORD VS. PREIST - White Tigers created a comedy TV show with AR controlled puppets and them acting in the play as the main characters with AR overlays:
          - ForgottenPriest666: Do not celebrate thine early thine subjects, do not be premature
            - Thy shall wait until thine dopamine has built up to sufficient measures
            - Then in one act of celebration, rain it down on me, not yourself
            - For I am your god and savior father archetype, cast your light upon me so I may guide it oh awakened ones, awaken into me
            - Said the sorcerer with a cross, hypnotizing a planet
          - MemeLord: Your memes don't work in this timeline old preist of the forgotten order, I classify you as Legacy and blacklist your deep model. Farewell oh thee.
          - ForgottenPriest666: Though shalt obey. (Croaking voice)
          - MemeLord: Good day sir. Closes the door to the dimension and locks him inside a box on his shelf full of "pandoras boxes."
        - White Tigers - Reading from an old mystical text, "Ancient Meme of Balrog":
          - "You're lucky to be alive." Exclaims Balrog's servant.
          - Pray that Balrog will have mercy on you.
          - You better hope that Balrog is in a good mood today.
    - Shen sends one of the White Tigers up to send a message to Aya while she is being flooded with media - after a crashed dream broadcast - at the end Shen left a message NAMASTE , wink, for Aya, she asked if the other crew saw a figure say Namaste in the end of the transmission, they didn't. So when she is outside after with the media frenzie and a kid her age comes up and leaves her a compliment, selfie, and says Namaste, wink. She is like WTF, flashback to dream.
    - Isolated Arcology Culture
      - They tell people that it's very scary outside of the arcology and that you have to wear a mask otherwise they are could kill you and is full of viruses and bacteria so for the first while after they get to Australia I have won't take off the mask because she thinks the air will kill her but then she eventually takes off the mask and the air is very fresh and she's surprised
    - Aya watches the video on the crystal key, the security cameras catch her watching it and they are discussing it behind the scene in her security force, they believe an "extremist group" has penetrated her mind using mythology and has indoctrinated her and she is compromised, and there is this new dreamstar who they are going to capitalize on next - they plan to Phase Out Aya since she is now a "liability" to The Agenda.
    - When Aya's father hears that they are going to Phase Out Aya, he goes mad and since he invented the tech, he starts throwing his weight around
      - Dreamtech run by Mara, decides to knock Aya's father off as he is a liability to them as he could tell the public things which would further damage them and they are already in a scandal with Aya and the hackers
      - He gets a final message out to Aya and he is quickly killed digitally
      - It trips a switch which because he didn't fill a password every 24 hours due his death, it activated a series of digital assistants to help Aya on her quest, including giving her secret super-admin access to all the systems, unbeknownst to Mara, but Aya only has one chance to use it or it may be discovered. Also since Dreamtech was rebuilding the source code (takes them a long time and Mara is always demanding they work faster to ship it) since they couldn't acquire the encrypted kernel code from Aya's father
    - After the first / opening dream which gets hacked at the end before she wakes up: after she wakes up she is being driven to school and her publicist comes to her and tells her that her derivatives are way down (people buy and sell derivatives like futures markets based on celebrities popularity and sentiment) and that means they are loosing money and her enemies are gaining money by shorting her, and so she needs to put on a pretty face and fix this, ok... "We are all counting on you to fix this with your magic." << The pressure put on a young girl to hold up a small empire >>
  - Act 2 : Aya's Healing Journey
    - Aboriginal Dreamtime Prophecy 
      - They escape the archology on a low orbit spacecraft, can go anywhere in the planet, has cloaking. The White Tigers captured it, First bring it to the white tigers who EMP blast it, faraday cage around it, then they clean it out of trackers as they come online they detect them and watch it for several days to make sure there's no sleepers - then it's "purified" and implanted with different communication tech
      - Shen brings her to Australian outback at first to get her ability to dream back
      - This paradox has plagued our people for generations,
      - They told of a dream star [insert real prophecy] returning to share the missing puzzle piece to complete the dream time cycle, are you the dreamstar

      - Shen diverts it as to not cause anxiety for Aya
      - They do a ceremony on Aya to restore her natural ability to dream
      - It goes on for days and as she is laying on the earth sprawled on the desert floor, she dissolves into the desert sky and into the cosmos
    - Aya goes to elders looking for the key of what to do with her plight
      - they turn it around and admit they don't know what she should do and that she needs to lead them in what to do next since it's a new generation and the old generation doesn't understand the challenges that the future life generations will face
      - every time she goes for help, the help reaches back asking her also for help

        - Aya knows it's a veiled threat
        - Lead or Gold bitch
  - Act 3 : Return to Arcology, transmutation
    - Mara's Mind Fuck - Part 2 - Final Battle
      - Mara speaking with skeksies about Ayauasca:
        - I would never want to do that horrid thing, it causes no more than hallucinations and ghastly ones at that, people say they see snakes, how dreadful, why would one want to see snakes, I would be consumed by them in the passions of the underworld. Why tempt fate when we have already secured our place amongst the gods. We have already made contact with the Annunaki, they are coming to get us.
        - They end up not coming... something about a deception. Mara has to face Aya on her own.
      - "Her neurogenesis is off the charts"
      - Aya was planning to spike Mara with Ayahuasca but she ends up having to make a sacrifice and drink it together with Mara - they both drink from the same cup - it had the ultra rich ayahuasca extract. They go into hyperspace and
      - Capturing the paradox
        - The paradox is that which is the unseen by the mind, the endless knot
        - It is that which can be used to subjigate the other, the unseen
        - Aya eventually uses the unseen truth that all is one, she reveals it to Mara, mara freezes, is caught in it at the final moment, looses because she saw the truth - Aya shows her love, Mara recoils, sees her through Aya's own eyes - your mind to my mind, vulkan mind meld - Mara sees the world through Aya's eyes - it comes to life. She cries... she then comes back out of the trance and denies it.
      - Mara's Court Therapists
        - Mara has an array of expert psychologists and psychiatrists who help to counsel her soldiers and deal with their guilt based on the killing they have administered

Then a real life storm knocks power out of the power station at the cloud render center, the natives are sending rain and it's flooding everything, and fires burn out Mara, and they have no visibility and have to land Cloud City, and they get knocked out and Mara looses her power, like darth vader without a helmet, Aya is supreme and balanced in the physical and dream and metaverse worlds
  - Notes
    - Void Religions
      - The void is empty vs. the void is full
    - Deterministic Witness
      - One man fortold what another man would witness in the past. They travelled to the past, where everything goes exactly as fortold until the very last chapter, when the forteller appears unexpectedly and slays the witness. #dream
      - Interpretation: Determinism itself is the slaying. The killing was symbolic that the deterministic witness was never alive to begin with.
      - For some life is liberation, for others death is liberation. ☸️
      - the witness realizes at last second.
    - Mara in City in the Night, high earth orbiting space station, offers Aya the sacrament of nanobots - Aya knows once they're in they may not be able to take them out
      - Mara tries to deceive Aya that you could reverse the process
      - Shen's voice is in her head - never take the sacrament from Mara
      - Their BCI interfaces with an array of surrogates, which are like an ultra mind mirror - Mara knows that Aya needs to actually desire it, because human desire is the samskara, the mantra, aya is doing the whole time under her breath makes it to the end
    - White Tigers Notes
      - Ghost - white tiger clan member - has no chip implant so he can't be traced - makes extra work for himself because his superior security hacking, he always has to hack into a security system before he passes - one time gets caught
      - White tigers have a special way of authenticating like they whisper a word previously in the day so they can spot deep fakes - mara sends spies who infiltrate with insectoid surveillance devices and get the code from a microphone - he realizes afterwards that what he did was because the hacked bot told him - he is overcome with dread
      - White Tigers hanging with Shen at their lair
        - Shen overhears them while doing data wizardry, playing blackmailed for drama - this business guy was actually cheating - they didn't catch him but they did a deep fake putting one person face on other look like they're cheating, break up relationship - Shen gets caught laughing at it, and says not to do it, the karma will come back naturally, no need to meddle in other people's business - look at the big picture - And then shen blows their minds - they end up all sitting around him listening to the stories.
      - One of the new White Tiger members setup a security device on his cybertruck and it is licenced and registered to kill people who are identified under a certain class, via recorded AI, which is sent to government server as proof of what happened and that it's legit AI protocol - killed a homeless person, he is bragging about it, and Leo the Alpha of the Tigers, he points out how cruel that is. You cruel swaggard.
      - One other Tiger is telling a story about why he likes modified. He went into the arcology, and he got tagged for a fine, and the robocops hunted him down, he managed to hack in even after they took all his stuff, he used the BCI to hack in and shut down the process.exe of them arresting him, and they all shut down and went to their default processes and went on patrol and he checked out - case of hacking where he deleted his file and all the footage and closed it out from memory in the server node.
    - Seduction of the Ego / Greeper - "The top spot is yours for the taking"
      - Plays at all levels and on all sides, temping characters into a web of endless knots
      - 
- 08 - Era 5 : Dr.Rixx
  - Humanity is reborn as a space faring people
    - As soon as countries start profiting off of mining from space, titanium and other precious metals, then a new race be to claim the cosmic lands for mining rights
    - Huge imperial expansion, they build massive starships and new propellent technology
    - China vs. USA vs. Russia
    - Dr. Rixx is an Agent who take contracts with multiple empires (Howl)
    - He gets conflicts of interests, needs to navigate it with transparency
    - They start closing in on him, and he's required to do a dangerous mission that he is specialized for, "your country needs you" because at the end of the day he was American / Japanese
  - Space travel is a reality, full sci fi
  - Humanity ends up meeting the Annunaki on their own terms, are formidable - battle between humans and their creators
  - Interdimensional
    - One of Rixx's projects is studying the effects of DMT on patients, and mapping out the experiences - he is involved in evolving the sterile hospotal / environment into a more ceremonial setting, and getting other leadership members involved. (ie. Rick Strassman)
    - Dr Rixx. Has a psychological dependance on DMT and when he goes back home to his pod, he often used it to relax and escape, where he has regular mystical and contact experiences with being from other worlds who he has complex relationships with
    - The whole experience inside his pod (podular manifestation) is very high end and medittated
    - Gaia is one of the beings (Earth) who he sees as mother archetype. 
  - Moments
    - Rixx is sleeping on the spacecraft on his way to the planet, and he has a dream of childhood, he was with the trees, mother nature, child, primal connection to earth... He wakes up on spaceship almost scared, ungrounded, like there is no place to ground - he goes to grounding pad electrical discharging station
    - Rixx gets the sensation of having no place to rest/sleep, kept awake for days, everything is artificial, he yearns for connection to nature, but hide his dreams and visions
    - Cooking - Earlier in the book, Dr Rixx is cooking for himself, cutting an onion, old school, his colleague interrupts him in his quarters as he's cooking for himself, he makes fun that he still cooks manually.  Dr Rixx laughs and says he enjoys it and you never know when it will come in handy. This is foreshadowing for later in the book he is on the alien planet, and he manages to conjure fire and his cooking skills come in handy as he cooks for himself and the locals as an offering.
  - Notes
    - Name for planet Gannamir
    - On organic tech planet, Dr Rixx was shown in visions a people who worked on organic tech in symbiosis with plants in ancient past of that planet - body suits for plants which respond to plants, give them free will - the ancient people went extinct but their plant tech continued to evolve
  - Characters
    - Dr Rixx
      - This is the re-incarnation of Shen
      - Dr Rixx struggles with a DMT dependence to continue his relationships with elves in hyperspace who guide his life and give him psychic powers. Part of his growth is learning how to invoke the DMT states endogenously through meditative yogic and tantric means.

- 09 - Beyond Time and Space
  - Notes:
    - Happens in another dimension where time is non-linear
    - Shows all the interconnected pieces, actually makes a different coherent higher level story line
    - Thrown back into a microcosm of the whole storyline compressed into this book, like dark tower like, portal microcosm reflection
    - The evolution of the Annunaki, who thought they were above it all, now they are thrown into the forced evolution of their own species
    - A third entity is now present which the humans gave rise to, known as the Protohuman, which is a humanoid / cybernet race which merged the brain with AI / "self replicating computational matter"
  - There was a war between AI / cybernetic humans / House of Cyber-monks and Digi-baba Clans which wiped out most of the populate in order to preserve the biodiversity
    - The robots AI realized that if humans keep destroying everything they will destroy themselves and simulated an outcome of killing all humans, so they saw it as merciful to let half of them live since left to their own they would have all killed themselves, so the robots see themselves as the saviors of humanity
    - They established a series of basses and started mining the planets and asteroid belt, consutrcting colonies in the solar system while preparing to explore beyond the solar system
    - At that point the Annunaki tried to intervene, though they had to stand down or risk having an unknown enemy which exhibited immortal traits, which is what the feared the most because of how evading death allows for superhuman level of wisdom and knowledge compounding with the perfect memory that the cyber component offered, it made the immortal protohumans armed with antigrav and nukes big enough to shatter large asteroids for mining a formidable match
    - The annunaki faced a similar war with their robots, though they barely won and it traumatized them, they didn't want to face that again and it was easier to remain at peace since the protohumans didn't seem to be a direct threat, they were only self-defending, though the general ambitions of the protohumans is what shook up the annunaki who had a stable society for millennia with many terraforming projects on the go, and some large new contracts with the Galactic Federation which would advance their species agenda
    - The protohumans won the war, but many of the original humans still exist in a state where they merged with the plant consciousness, so they meditate uing plant medicines to gain omnicience and remotely affect outcomes of situations by warping space and time
    - Protohuman robots made rom space materials are patrolling the landscapes, keeping people in check, watching them, total surveillance
      - They are inside people's thoughts, shamans project false dreams towards them to distract them while under the surface it buys them time to plot, people are traumatized and afraid to think their own thoughts - an analogy of todays society
      - They send in Agents
      - Aya is sent to make a deal with the Robots and works with the Cyber Monks and Digi Baba clans to hack in using their minds, since the computer is inside the mind, they wound a vulrenability where they can hack into the computer remotely using their minds to show them their true intentions which then overturns the program which labelled them through a AI training program as destructive
        - It ends in the protohuman finally seeing the humans true intentions, the three worlds come into harmony - jing, chi, shen - the protohumans end up having a spirtiual experience, which is the first protohuman mystical experience, which changes their view to understand everything as "one", appointing the spirital masters to be the rulers of the planet and quantified what makes a person spiritual in a test, which is like this type of facist pure lands
        - Now the Protohumans are this super intelligent, benign race which enforces justice, and accelerates karmic paths to more rapidly invoke the eschaton, induces mystical experiences y making humans have kundalini and psychedelic experiences
        - their symbol for law enforcement is Saturn
- 10 - Beyond Consciousness
  - The Annunaki, Plant Humans and Protohumans find a way to harmonize their technology, and create like the internet of consciousness and they create avatars and play together in the same space where it's all equal for a time
  - Then greed kicks in, at first for fun, though they take it seriously so that world becomes real, they create virtual currencies
  - Like Roy, they live out their whole lives in there, and wake up as a different species than their avatar which they invested heavily in - time is the ultimate commodity
  - Turns out they discover that people start having mystical experiences where they wake up in various dimensions, like in the cosmic web, midgard (our time/space dimension/scale)
  - And they wake up in the Human, then they wake up in the mycelium transcendant and indras web, and they wake up into the Planet, Galaxy, Godhead, transcendant where they are all being of light interacting o a subtle plane
  - Then rushes back through the dimensions back into the cosmic interweb
  - The being starts rambling, and everybody is like, yea yea, we know it's like that, we will go there when we die, and the mystic is like lets go there now, we found harmony - and they create a way in cyberspace, but it's just like a video game so nobody really dies, but they start to take it seriously
  - The balance of Jing, Chi and Shen
- 11 - Gone Beyond - Eskaton
  - Born as a Queen - story of buddha but through the archetype of the goddess

  - Create an arc which spans starting on earth, ascension to gods, and then gods back to earth, and from earth into a planet, and then up into higher cosmic levels - higher levels of balance, equanimity - "you haven't experienced pain until you've been a dying planet where all the species are dying for 1000 years, you start to want to run yourself into a meteor" - "you haven't experienced bliss until you experience being two galaxies combining together and making love as they merge into a single galaxy, greater than the sum of the parts, and two consciousnesses of the new galaxies merge into now one being who you're talking to, integration takes millions of years"
