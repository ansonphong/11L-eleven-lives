- White tiger joking
	- One pulls one over on the other guy
		- That's false because the inverted paradox theorum states that you're always wrong and I'm always right.

MEME LORD VS. PREIST

Priest: Do not celebrateth thine early thine subjects
Thy shall wait until thine dopamine has built up to sufficient measures
Then in one act of celebration, rain it down on me, not yourself
I am your god and heavenly father, cast your light upon me so I may guide it.

Said the sorcerer with a cross.

MemeLord: Your memes don't work in this timeline old preist of the forgotten christ order, I classify you as Legacy and blacklist your deep pattern. Good bye.

Preist: Though shalt obey. (Croaking voice)

MemeLord: Good day sir.
