Asir and varnir, from the realm of the gods

Because the Asir won and what they celebrated was the loss of their fertility, as they had destroyed the life force of what make them exist. It was all shiva with no shakti. After their victory, the Asir went back to the Varnir and attempted a series of peace treaties.

I suggest we skip to the end of the story and enter a transcendant view of reality, something we consider pure truth or fundamental to our initial causality of this company.

The conditions have changed since the origin and so adaptation is required.

This is the place we started and this is the place I think we must come back to with fresh eyes and 4 years behind us. From this place we can forge our current agreement and get on with it.


It is my movement that the agreements needs to be re-established within a vesting algorythm. 

I want to hear both of your views about this before a yay or nay.

I comprehensive view of time acheiving full closure, as closure is the opening of the new cycle
