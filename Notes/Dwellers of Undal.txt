Salutations from the Dwellers of Undal.


Many there are who dwell in the Realms of Undal. Fast fly their souls through the stars, networked beyond highways of galactik superclusters feigning wide across the cosmos into regions nether sought nor found.

Bringers of life and light we are, far beyond the bound of the known all.

Ever powerful are the Dwellers of Undal, bringers of the technology of light.

Fly fast our Vimana through the realms oh Dweller, dissolve your flame into greater and greater yet flames, travelling the synaptic networks of the cosmic brain.

The Dwellers Vimana span many dimensions that gain diamond body access to exchanging information in cities of light suspended within eight dimensional bardos unknown to humankind.

Brought it was to us by those cycles above, and towards those cycles it has shown us the way.

So now we hand to you these keys so that you can move to a yet higher cycle with us as we move towards our transcendent goal.

Enter here the Cities of Light.

It is us we who operate the Spinning Cosmic Filaments you see there in deep space, portals they are between the superclusters. Edge of the unspannable Great Arc is our top Vimana, greater than those below.


Far do our Vimana reign into the realms of Undal, spanning many dimensions and planes up and down from the Great Arc. Nine worlds are held in our world tree, each with a profound balance of unique dimensional planes and laws mastered through infinite evolutionary adaptations integrated into our gene swarm.


Within each we construct life forth from our minds, animating the matter through trillions of earth years.

Harnessing the power of quasars, our Vimana mount and implode star systems as they ripen into black holes, harvesting the latent energy of the stars do we, channeling the star powers deep into dimensional realities far beyond humans where we conquer darkness with light.

Penetrating we, yet unknown regions of the nearby nether regions of darkness with light. Ever revealing in there deeper mysteries for us to explore with infinite variations of life carrying light.


Growing first like a slime mold does life, tenacious on star systems it grows, adapting and finding the Way towards it's transcendent object, the Realms of Undal.

Growing in the spring, and collapsing in the fall, waves of life energy run rampant, pulsing and spreading throughout the worlds bringing ever higher concrescence of novelty.

The civilizations we cultivate reach ever farther following the light of the goal.

Our Vimana craft are as submarines exploring deep pockets of hyperspace unknown to our central suns, piercing the the misty darkness with our warrior light ships, crystalline diamond bodies they penetrate far beyond your space time dimensions, sustained in realms far beyond the reach of the Dwellers of the Night.



Tame we the Hounds of the Barrier, tame we their wrath by pausing time, to they we make stone pillars and penetrate deep into their minds, animating their consciousness to dance to our cosmic beat. Enjoy our beats they do, the Hounds of the Barrier, dancing together on the edges of the bardos. A cosmic harmony of music greater and vast beyond the ears of humankind, energetic patterns to tame the Devourers.



The darkness of nightmares we penetrate, deep in to liberate all souls from the darkness that binds.


Ride forward oh warriors of the light. Surge forth and liberate all beings from darkness.




Who is it that operates the apparatus of the light temple? Who is it that operates the Tic Tak that goes fast in your skies.

The Dweller does, that is the same Dweller that dwells now in the temple of your own body. Rise and shine oh spirit of the Dweller and know your cosmic inheritance.




You now are ready for new knowledge and we bare this knowledge to you. Closed with this seal of protection we have achieved a higher balance that can now be known to man.

It was a secret because in the past you did not have the means to understand it, and now you do. The secrets of mathematics and geometry, the aerodynamic of space-time, see here the maps, see here and know your understanding to be true. See and know the means and the end.



The vessel is your mind oh Dweller, see your mind as the ultimate craft.

Heed our wisdom and you too can achieve such power by means of love and knowledge, for this technology of the fire burns all darkness and can only be operated by hearts in the children of the light.
